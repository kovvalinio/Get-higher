# Get_higher_game
 
This repository contains a code for the game made by me during the first year of studies.

Get higher is a record type game and (as the title tells us) in which we need to get as high as it is possible.
During climbing we face monsters that gives us additional points. 

Control: up, down, left, right arrows and space.
